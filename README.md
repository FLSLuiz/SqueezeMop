Problem with stripe: Stripe only accepts integer values not floats, i'm using floating points values in my entire project. Checkout should be functional but not at the moment, as i would have to change a lot in my code, will come back to it later.

To fix: Cart; Account; Past orders; Payment; Success page; Logout. 

Needs to be done urgently: Proper documentation, more comments and explanations throughout the project.

Would like to implement later on: SQL Server; Dockerize the project; Have it run on a cloud server.
